# FE_War_of_Retribution_DEMO
This is a demo of a Fire Emblem 8 The Sacred Stones rom hack that I am making.
I still have a lot to do in this hack, but I would appricate your feedback on this.
There are five chapters in this demo, but the full hack will most likely have about 18 chapters and maybe 3 gaiden chapters.
Please fill out this google form when you finish the demo.

The full hack is still a long time away from being completed, so don't expect it anytime soon.
Here is a link that describes how to apply a patch. You will need a copy of Fire Emblem the Sacred Stones to apply the patch to.
